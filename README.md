My Name is Andrey Ivanov. I am Russian and have been living in New York City since 2008. I am the Baruch College Graduate with Computer Information Systems Major. This is my little blog.

I was introduced to JavaScript in January of 2017 as I started take first lessons on FreeCodeCamp. I am now joining the FullStack Academy and this is my first week of Foundations part. I hope to see my knowledge and skills in JS improve, as it is big time and financial investment. 

I will try and post here every week about how things go and current progress.

Very excited about the fact that axactly the month from now, the immersive phase of the Fullstack Acaemy begins. Currently it is one week into the Foundations program, that should put up all of the students to the same level at the start of the immersion. 

Just finished the first week checkpoint (completeded in 2 hours and evaluated), which seemed to me not so much challenging, as other problems in the first week. So far the program covered Loops, Clousures, Objects and Object protottypes. By far the morst difficult to me was to wrap my head around the conept of the Clousure. 

Off it goes the week two and the second part of Foundations. Let's see what it is like. Really excited.

Through the last week I had several online meetings with future class mates. It turns out to be very helpful in terms of understanding the introduced concepts. One of the guys is very experienced and open to explain stuff.  
I took on the second checkpoint and had problems with the closure problem and the one related to call site. In the closure I failed to understand the specs. In the other one I completely missed on the .call method. One of the features of .call methods is that it can setup the call site by taking in specific object, to which this will be pointing on execution. It can take any object (array, functino, constructor). 
Hope that I passed the checkpoint. Currently work on HTML and CSS. I have to catch up with the Guessing Game project.
