# My Blog

Post 1.

My Name is Andrey Ivanov. I am Russian and have been living in New York City since 2008. I am the Baruch College Graduate with Computer Information Systems Major. This is my little blog.

I was introduced to JavaScript in January of 2017 as I started take first lessons on FreeCodeCamp. I am now joining the FullStack Academy and this is my first week of Foundations part. I hope to see my knowledge and skills in JS improve, as it is big time and finansial investment. 

I will try and post here every week about how things go and current progress.
