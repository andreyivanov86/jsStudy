My Name is Andrey Ivanov. I am Russian and have been living in New York City since 2008. I am the Baruch College Graduate with Computer Information Systems Major. This is my little blog.

I was introduced to JavaScript in January of 2017 as I started take first lessons on FreeCodeCamp. I am now joining the FullStack Academy and this is my first week of Foundations part. I hope to see my knowledge and skills in JS improve, as it is big time and financial investment.

I will try and post here every week about how things go and current progress.

Very excited about the fact that exactly the month from now, the immersive phase of the Fullstack Academy begins. Currently it is one week into the Foundations program, that should put up all of the students to the same level at the start of the immersion.

Just finished the first week checkpoint (completed in 2 hours and evaluated), which seemed to me not so much challenging, as other problems in the first week. So far the program covered Loops, Closures, Objects and Object prototypes. By far the most difficult to me was to wrap my head around the concept of the Closure.

Off it goes the week two and the second part of Foundations. Let's see what it is like. Really excited.

Through the last week I had several online meetings with future class mates. It turns out to be very helpful in terms of understanding the introduced concepts. One of the guys is very experienced and open to explain stuff.

I took on the second checkpoint and had problems with the closure problem and the one related to call site. In the closure I failed to understand the specs. In the other one I completely missed on the .call method. One of the features of .call methods is that it can setup the call site by taking in specific object, to which this will be pointing on execution. It can take any object (array, function, constructor).

Hope that I passed the checkpoint. Currently work on HTML and CSS. I have to catch up with the Guessing Game project.

One week away from the immersive phase in the Fullstack. Monday Sep 11 is the first day. I have passed the final checkpoint test, but have not felt comfortable with my performance. I feel like, what was offered to learn, does not stick unless used continuously. Some challenges in the test were easy, some I had no idea how to solve. The reason to it is that I simply do not have enough skill to handle them. We have reviewed the challenges with the guys and it turned out that I should be able to solve them. It was more about the correct approach to the algorithm. I need to learn how to solve simple problems in no time. Probably pen and paper should be handy.

Another thing is, that I've completed the GuessingGame project. While it is somehow functioning, it looks ugly, and need some more work on the logics. Thus, I have to learn CSS and jQuery more thoroughly, needless to say about the JS itself. I see what has to be done, but do not know how...

Anyway, there are these three months to come. It all should be taken care of.
